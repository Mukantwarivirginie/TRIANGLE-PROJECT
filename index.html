<h1>TRIANGLE TRACKER</h1>

<p><strong>Triangle</strong> is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. 
    It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 
    A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted. 
    In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, 
    determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane
    
    <h1>Type of Triangle</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles which always add up to 180°.

The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that:
  The longest side of any triangle must be 
  less than the sum of the other 2 sides.

Triangles are classified in 2 ways-

1) By the number of equal sides they have:
  • scalene - all 3 sides have different lengths
  • isosceles - 2 sides have equal lengths
  • equilateral - all 3 sides are equal

2) By the types of angles they have:
  • acute triangle - all 3 angles are acute (less than 90°)
  • right triangle - has one right angle (a right angle = 90°)
  • obtuse triangle - has one obtuse angle (an obtuse angle is greater than 90° and less than 180°).
</li>
</ul>
