<h1>TRIANGLE TRACKER</h1>

<p><strong>Triangle</strong> is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. 
    It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 
    A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted. 
    In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, 
    determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane
